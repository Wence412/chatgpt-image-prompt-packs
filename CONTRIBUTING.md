## 📋 Before You Start

✅ **Do:**
- Follow the [S.E.E.D. Framework](docs/seed-framework.md)
- Test your prompts in ChatGPT-Image 2.0
- Use the production checklist before submitting
- Provide real-world use cases
- Document winning variations
- Include relevant tags for categorization

❌ **Don't:**
- Request real-person likenesses without explicit permission
- Include copyrighted characters or logos
- Generate prompts for harmful use cases
- Submit untested or vague prompts
- Duplicate existing prompts without improvements
- Add random text or unvalidated output

---

## 🚀 Quick Start: Adding a New Prompt

### Step 1: Set Up Your Fork
```bash
# Fork the repo on GitHub
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/chatgpt-image-prompt-packs.git
cd chatgpt-image-prompt-packs

# Create a new branch
git checkout -b add/your-prompt-name
```

### Step 2: Create Your Prompt
Use the S.E.E.D. framework:

```text
Subject: [What is the hero?]
Elements: [Props, colors, materials?]
Environment: [Where is this taking place?]
Details: [Lens, lighting, style, constraints?]
Production line: [Quality standards and output requirements?]
```

**Example:**
```
Create a premium studio mockup of [product] for [brand] on a clean matte surface 
with soft shadows, elegant reflections, and a minimalist background in [color palette]. 
Use commercial-grade lighting, realistic product proportions, accurate materials, 
depth of field, no random text, and brand-safe visual treatment. Output should be 
clean, polished, and ready for web/print without editing.
```

### Step 3: Test Your Prompt
```bash
# Generate the image in ChatGPT-Image 2.0
# Rate the output quality
# Note any variations or refinements
# Document the winning version
```

### Step 4: Add to `data/prompts.json`

```json
{
  "id": "P1-XXX",
  "phase": "Phase 1",
  "category": "Your Category",
  "title": "Your Prompt Title",
  "prompt": "Your full S.E.E.D. prompt text here...",
  "best_for": "Visual ideation, product concepts, [your use case]",
  "framework": "Subject + context + style + environment + materials + camera/framing + lighting + brand constraints + output format",
  "tags": [
    "category-tag",
    "specific-prompt-tag",
    "chatgpt-image-2",
    "commercial-use"
  ]
}
```

### Step 5: Update `data/categories.json`

If adding to a new category:

```json
"Your New Category": [
  "P1-XXX",
  "P1-YYY"
]
```

### Step 6: Create a Pull Request

```bash
# Commit your changes
git add data/prompts.json data/categories.json
git commit -m "Add P1-XXX: Your Prompt Title"

# Push to your fork
git push origin add/your-prompt-name

# Create PR on GitHub with:
# Title: "Add P1-XXX: Your Prompt Title"
# Description: Explain the use case and why it's valuable
```
